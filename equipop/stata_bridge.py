"""
stata_bridge.py - the pure-Python side of the Stata integration.

Design: everything computable lives HERE (tested by pytest, no Stata
required); the .ado file's python block only moves arrays across the
sfi boundary and calls knn_to_rows(). That keeps the untestable-
outside-Stata surface to a few lines.

The contract that makes the Stata round trip work: results come back
ROW-ALIGNED to the input observations (one value per individual, the
spec's "disaggregated outfile"), so the ado can store them straight
into the dataset in memory and the user can `regress` immediately.
Rows with missing coordinates receive missing values.

BACKLOG 136: this module is the SHARED dispatch that every door
funnels through - QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, Stata and the Python API - so its
messages are read by all of them. It used to prefix them "[stata]",
which John found in an ArcGIS Pro log: "[stata] returning 4 new
variables". A Pro user reading their own log had no idea why Stata was
involved, and it quietly contradicted the one architectural claim the
project makes about itself. The prefix is now "[equipop]". The MODULE
NAME is the same problem in slower motion and is left for 120, when
this file is being moved anyway - anyone writing the R or SPSS door of
133 will still open stata_bridge.py to find dispatch().

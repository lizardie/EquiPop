"""
rasterfolder.py - load a FOLDER of rasters into one point table.

BACKLOG 206. Written to John's rule, and the rule is about geometry
rather than filenames:

    rasters of DIFFERENT GROUND do not overlap  -> they become ROWS
    rasters of the SAME GROUND do overlap       -> they become COLUMNS

That is measurable, so the merge never depends on a naming convention
and will survive WorldPop renaming everything. Filenames are used ONLY
to LABEL the columns, because a wrong label is cosmetic and visible
while a wrong merge is silent and corrupts the data.

AND THE TEST IS DATA OVERLAP, NOT EXTENT OVERLAP. Burundi and Rwanda
share a bounding box over 1.4 million cells and do not share ONE pixel
carrying data in both. An extent-based merge would call them the same
ground and add two countries into a single column.

ZEROS ARE KEPT (John, explicitly). A pixel holding no women aged 15-19
may hold three men, so the point set is the UNION over every raster and
a layer with nothing there contributes a real 0.0, not an absence. The
old rasters_to_points() decided the point set from whichever variable
came first, which silently deleted exactly those pixels.

Usage:
    from equipop.rasterfolder import load_folder
    pts, man = load_folder("Africa/")            # every raster in it
    pts, man = load_folder(["Africa/", "Europe/"])
    pts, man = load_folder("Africa/", sum_cohorts=True)   # one column

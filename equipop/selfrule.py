selfrule.py - is the origin its own neighbour? (BACKLOG 290).

THE PROBLEM. EquiPop grows a neighbourhood outward from each origin
until it holds k people, and it has always started counting AT THE
ORIGIN CELL. Your own cell's people are your nearest neighbours, and
they include you.

For an accessibility question that is right: people standing at the
clinic can reach the clinic. For a composition question it puts the
origin's own value on both sides of the comparison, and for a spatial
weights matrix W it is not merely unhelpful but wrong by convention -
SAR, SDM and SLX all require w_ii = 0, and `autocorr.build_weights()`
has always excluded self while the counting machines have always
included it. TWO NEIGHBOURHOOD DEFINITIONS IN ONE PACKAGE, both called
"the neighbourhood". That is what this module ends.

MEASURED IN THE FIELD BY JOHN, NOT BY CLAUDE. On CaliData2010 - his
own five-county Los Angeles blocks, the data behind Osth, Clark and
Malmberg (2015) - the `include` path REPRODUCES THE 2014 SOFTWARE
EXACTLY. Run in Stata over 78,208 populated blocks, weighted by the
group, against the R_ column already in the file:

    2014 software     mean 0.2752264  sd 0.2464846  min 0.0004955
    EquiPop 1.47      mean 0.2752264  sd 0.2464846  min 0.0004955
    same, i!=j        mean 0.2378486  sd 0.2482518  min 0.0000000

Identical to seven decimals on four statistics, and Figure 4 of the
2015 paper reads ~0.28. Excluding the origin lowers African American
isolation by 13.6%.

THE MINIMUM IS THE PART TO NOTICE. Under i=j a block holding any
African American residents CANNOT score zero, because its own people
are inside its own neighbourhood. Under i!=j a block can hold them
and have no African American neighbours, and that is a true zero.
The rule changes which questions the number can answer, not just its
size.

(An earlier estimate in this file said 0.2765 and 13.4%. That was
Claude's own run with the neighbour search capped at 48 cells, which
never reached k for remote blocks. The evidence that the cap was the
cause was already in the same measurement - a median per-block
difference of 0.00000 with the index off by 0.0013 - and was read as
a real difference instead. FIELD NUMBERS REPLACE BENCH NUMBERS.)

THE SHIFT IS NOT UNIFORM AND THAT IS THE POINT. Minority members live
disproportionately in blocks where their group is concentrated, so
their own block is a large part of their measured isolation. For a
63% majority the neighbourhood is White either way. Self-inclusion
therefore INFLATES MINORITY ISOLATION RELATIVE TO MAJORITY, and the
size of the inflation depends on how many people a unit holds.

It also bends the SCALE PROFILE, which is the more serious finding.
Across k = 100, 200, 400, 800 on the same data:

    African American, include   0.2765 -> 0.2525   (falls 0.0240)
    African American, exclude   0.2394 -> 0.2357   (falls 0.0037)

Six times less decline. Over that range the origin block shrinks from
roughly all of the neighbourhood to about a seventh of it, so most of
the slope at small k is THE ORIGIN BLOCK BEING DILUTED rather than the
surrounding composition changing. Mean block population in that
extract is 113 people and 35.6% of blocks hold 100 or more, so at
k=100 the "hundred nearest neighbours" IS the origin block and nothing
else for over a third of the region.

None of this touches the macroscale conclusions of the 2015 paper. By
k=6,400 and certainly by 51,200 the origin block is negligible and the
decline there is real. What it qualifies is the steep microscale end,
and the reading of k=100 as "a local neighbourhood" when for a third
of blocks it is one block.

WHY THE DEFAULT DOES NOT CHANGE, ruled by John, 1.47: every number in
the published literature - his 2015 paper included - was computed with
self included. A silent flip would break the correspondence between
this software and the papers that describe it. `include` stays, and
anyone who wants w_ii = 0 asks for it.

THE THIRD RULE THAT WAS CONSIDERED AND DROPPED. An intermediate rule
was designed and tested: remove ONE AVERAGE RESIDENT of the origin
cell, n' = n - 1 and t' = t - t/n. It has attractive properties - it
preserves the origin cell's own balance exactly (10 people of whom 1
is treated give 0.1000, not 1/9 = 0.1111), it IS the expectation of
suppressing a random individual (0.0999 over 200,000 draws), and the
same formula collapses correctly on individual-level rows where n=1
and the row simply vanishes. It was dropped because it does nothing.
On the LA blocks it moved isolation from 0.2765 to 0.2764. Removing
one person from a unit of 113 is noise; the contamination is your
CELL-MATES, not you. Kept here because the next session to reinvent
it should find the measurement rather than repeat the work.

WHAT EXCLUSION INTERACTS WITH:

  - SELF-POTENTIAL (selfpot.py, BACKLOG 95) has nothing to act on when
    the origin cell contributes no mass. It is not an error to pass
    both; the self-potential simply has no effect, and a run says so.
  - An ISOLATED origin - no other populated cell within reach - counts
    nobody. N_k comes back 0 and every share is undefined rather than
    invented. That is a real answer to "who is around me, not counting
    me", and it is why the column is not silently filled.
  - N_local and <var>_local are facts about THE CELL, not about the
    neighbourhood, so they are unchanged by this rule.

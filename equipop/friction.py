friction.py - the friction growth model (EquiPop Flow / FARB core).

THE MODEL (Östh & Türk 2020, ch. 22): neighbourhood growth proceeds
from each origin to its eight surrounding cells. A move costs its
TRUE LENGTH in cell widths - 1 for an orthogonal step, sqrt(2) for a
diagonal - and a cell with friction value f delays passage in
proportion to the distance travelled through it:

    included_round(neighbour) = included_round(cell)
                                + step * (1 + friction(neighbour))

where step = 1 or sqrt(2). Friction 0 = free passage; higher = later
inclusion. Neighbourhoods therefore grow fast along low-friction
paths and refuse to jump across barriers (water, motorways) unless
waiting out the delay.

WHY step-scaled (BACKLOG 139): before v1.29.9 every move cost the
same, so eight moves in any direction reached the same round and the
reachable set on open ground was the SQUARE Chebyshev ball rather
than a disc. An empty barrier layer therefore changed the answer,
which no friction model may do. Friction is a delay per unit
TRAVELLED, not a toll paid at the door.

THE HONEST LIMIT: an 8-neighbour graph cannot walk in a straight
line, only in 45- and 90-degree steps, so its shortest path is the
OCTILE distance, max + (sqrt(2)-1)*min. That overstates true
Euclidean distance by up to 8.2%, worst at 22.5 degrees off an axis
and zero along an axis or a perfect diagonal. Rounds are therefore a
slight over-estimate of effort in off-axis directions; the bias is
systematic, bounded, and reported here rather than hidden.

IMPLEMENTATION: this is mathematically a shortest-path problem with
node weights, so we solve it exactly with Dijkstra on the grid graph
(scipy, C speed) rather than simulating rounds in Python. Cells are
then counted in order of their included-round; equal rounds form an
atomic 'ring' (same tie convention as the radial engine).

DEFAULT FRICTION for cells absent from the friction file is a user
decision (default_friction parameter). 0 means: unlisted land is
free, and the friction file lists BARRIERS (water, big roads). The
opposite convention (file lists fast roads, everything else slow)
is used in some studies - then set default_friction to the max.

    additive, cost is 1 + friction, so 0 is UNAMBIGUOUSLY "nothing

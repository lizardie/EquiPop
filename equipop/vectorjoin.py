vectorjoin.py - VECTOR FEATURES REDUCED TO VALUES ON THE LATTICE.

The missing half of John's OSM plan. Points already land on the grid
(latticejoin); lines and polygons did not, and LINES ARE WHAT FRICTION
NEEDS: `features_to_friction()`, `load_friction_table()` and
`run_knn_friction()` have existed for months waiting for this input.

WHAT THIS IS AND IS NOT
-----------------------
EquiPop reduces geometry to VALUES ON A LATTICE. It is not becoming a
GIS. Intersect, within and buffer as general operations belong in
QGIS, which does them better; what EquiPop adds is the lattice and the
k-neighbourhood. If this file grows spatial predicates for their own
sake, that boundary is gone.

THE UNIT IS THE MEASURE. John: "if we declare that the longest road
stretch in the unit defines the friction value we need to know WHERE
it is the longest". Quite so - "longest" is meaningless without a
cell, so friction is a property of THE CELL, not of the road. The
same aliasing rule applies as everywhere else: choose a unit at or
below the source spacing.

CLASSES COME FROM THE DATA. The groups a user works with - cafe plus
restaurant plus fast_food as "eateries" - are a DEFINITION they
supply. The values available to group are read from their own extract
by the inventory, never from a schema document: that is how the
WorldPop naming registry failed on all 120 of John's files.

    THE MODEL IS JOHN'S, session 12, and it is about BARRIERS rather
    than composition. A barrier's cost is the cost of CROSSING it: a
    river that clips a corner still has to be crossed, and a river
    running corner to corner is crossed once too. So presence, not
    length, is the honest measure for friction - and length-weighting
    would be the wrong rule wearing the clothes of precision.

    WHY `class` AND NOT `presence` IS THE DEFAULT. OSM cuts one street
    into many records wherever a tag changes - a speed limit, a
    bridge, a name. John's Swedish extract holds 2,139,630 road
    features, and his own screenshot shows `unclassified` three times
    and `trunk_link` twice within one junction, all one street. Under
    `presence` a cell containing five segments of one street is
    charged five times, so the friction would be partly a fact about
    HOW THE DATA WAS CUT rather than about the geography - worst in
    cities, where segmentation is densest and where the artefact
    would matter most. Under `class` a motorway crossing a cell in
    forty pieces counts once.

    `measure` keeps the length or area instead. It is the only
    defensible rule for a COMPOSITION question - what share of this
    cell is forest - and the wrong one for a barrier.

    THE VALUE COMES FROM A FIELD THE USER PREPARED, not from a table
    in a dialog: John's ruling, and it keeps the vocabulary problem
    where the vocabulary is. Missing values are the caller's to fill;
    the convention that goes with `agg` is 0 for additive and 1 for
    multiplicative, both meaning "no effect".

    features : as friction.paths_to_friction - dicts of
        {"type": "line"|"polygon", "parts": [...]}.
    values   : one number per feature, from that field.

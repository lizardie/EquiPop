fastcounts.py - vectorised counts-only k-NN engine (the fast path).

For the common case - aggregated counts, ratio output, no value
arrays - this engine replaces the per-origin Python loop with
KD-tree neighbour queries and cumulative sums over whole chunks of
origins at once. Same mathematics and the SAME ring-atomic tie
convention as run_knn_stats (verified by regression test); one to
two orders of magnitude faster on large datasets.

Use run_knn_stats when you need median/Gini/etc. of value variables;
use run_knn_counts for counts and ratios at scale.

    k-NN counts/ratios for every cell in cd, vectorised.

    origins : optional array of CELL indices - compute results only
        for these origins; the tree and destination mass stay GLOBAL,
        so per-origin results are exactly those of a full run (the
        tile-and-flush substrate, #18).
    self_potential : how far away your OWN cell's people are, 0 to 1
        (v1.29.5, BACKLOG 95). 0 reproduces every release up to
        1.29.3, where a cell that already held k people reported
        Dist_k = 0 and k stopped being a parameter. 1 (the default)
        uses the equal-area radius. See equipop/selfpot.py.
    self_rule : whether the origin cell is its own neighbour
        (1.47, BACKLOG 290). "include" (the default, and what every
        published EquiPop result used) or "exclude" for the w_ii = 0
        convention that spatial regression requires. Under "exclude"
        the origin cell contributes no people, self_potential has
        nothing to act on, and an origin with no populated neighbour
        within reach reports N_k = 0 with undefined shares rather
        than an invented number. N_local and <var>_local describe THE
        CELL and are unchanged either way. See equipop/selfrule.py.
    m_neighbors : how many nearest CELLS are fetched per origin in the
        fast pass. Origins whose cumulative population within
        m_neighbors cells does not reach max(k) are automatically
        re-run against all cells (exact, slower) - the parameter
        affects speed only, never results.

    Output columns: CellId, EastWest, NorthSouth, N_local,
    <var>_local, and per k: N_k, T_<var>_k, R_<var>_k, Dist_k,

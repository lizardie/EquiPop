decay.py - distance decay models.

Design goal: EASY TO EXTEND. All decay models live in the MODELS
dictionary below. To add your own model later, you only need one line:

    MODELS["power"] = lambda dist_m, beta: (dist_m + 1) ** beta

and it becomes available as Decay(model="power", beta=...).

Sign convention (important!)
----------------------------
We follow the half-life formulation from the EquiPop papers:

    beta = ln(0.5) / half_life_m          (beta is NEGATIVE)
    weight(dist) = exp(dist * beta)

so that weight(0) = 1, weight(half_life) = 0.5, weight(2*half_life) = 0.25.
Example: half_life_m = 8000  ->  beta = -0.0000866...

# TWO MEANINGS OF "HALF-LIFE"  -  BACKLOG 317

# name both, and old EquiPop implemented the first:
#
#   HALF-LIFE          the median m splits the AREA under the decay
#                      curve in half: half the trips are shorter than
#                      m, half longer. THE PAPER ADVOCATES THIS, and it
#                      is what a survey median commute means.
#   HALF-PROBABILITY   the weight is 0.5 at m: a neighbour at distance
#                      m counts half as much as one next door.
#
# They coincide ONLY for the exponential. EquiPop 1.30 to 1.47 used
# half-probability for every model, silently - a departure from the
# published method that nobody chose and nobody recorded. From 1.48
# half-life is the default again, as John ruled in session 12.
#
# THE AREA IS THE 1-D AREA under the curve on an x/y diagram, exactly
# as in the paper. On a DISC the coincidence moves to the Gaussian;
# that is recorded in BACKLOG 317 and deliberately not offered.

    THE PUBLISHED FORMULA WAS WRONG. Östh, Lyhagen and Reggiani (2016)
    Eq. A16 set erf(z) = 0.5, carrying over the exp-normal's logic. But
    there the integral starts at x = 0, the CENTRE of a half-Gaussian,
    so the area share is erf(z) itself. For the log-normal, u = ln(x)
    sends x = 0 to u = -infinity: the integral starts at the FAR LEFT
    of a full Gaussian and the share is (1 + erf(z))/2. erf = 0.5 is
    therefore the THREE-QUARTER point, and the published +/- roots put
    75% and 25% of the area before m. Verified exactly in session 12;
    both roots reproduce the paper's Table 1 to the last digit.

    For ln(d) the half point has one closed-form root, -1/(2 ln m).
    EquiPop uses ln(d+1) - John's choice, since ln(d) puts the weight
    at ZERO when d = 0 - and with the +1 the log-space integral starts
    at u = 0 instead of -infinity. So it is a TRUNCATED Gaussian and
    the closed form is only approximate: 0.94% out at m = 100 m, 0.07%
    at 6010 m. Solved exactly here instead; with u = ln(d+1),
    a = sqrt(-beta) and U = ln(m+1), the share of area before m is

        [erf(a U - 1/(2a)) + erf(1/(2a))] / [1 + erf(1/(2a))]

    which rises monotonically with a, so bisection is safe.

    Decay specification passed to run_knn(decay=...).

    Give EITHER beta directly OR half_life_m. half_life_m is usually
    the natural choice for a researcher, and `calibration` says what it
    MEANS:

      "half-life"         (default) half the trips are shorter than
                          half_life_m. Use for a survey median.
      "half-probability"  a neighbour at half_life_m counts half as much.

    The two coincide for negexp. For power only half-probability
    exists, and asking for half-life on power uses half-probability
    and says so. See BACKLOG 317.

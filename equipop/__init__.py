"""
EquiPop Pangea - k-nearest neighbour contextual analysis on gridded data.

Bespoke neighbourhoods around every location instead of administrative
boundaries: the nearest k people, the radius needed to reach them
(Dist_k), and what that neighbourhood contains.

Engines: radial counts and shares (fastcounts), value statistics
(analysis), effort over a friction surface (friction) and over terrain
(slope), distance decay with fixed or variable bandwidth (decay), and
tiled continental runs (bigrun). Post-analysis: segregation,
accessibility, FCA, spatial autocorrelation, areas.

Doors: a QGIS Processing plugin, an ArcGIS Pro toolbox, and Stata
commands. The doors move data and explain parameters; this package
calculates.

(This docstring said "no friction, no decay yet - those come in Phase
2" until 1.29.9 - BACKLOG 121.)

WHY THE IMPORTS BELOW LOOK ODD - BACKLOG 176, v1.37
---------------------------------------------------
Nothing heavy is loaded when you type `import equipop`. The names are
fetched from their modules the first time somebody asks for one.

`equipop.run_knn`, `from equipop import run_knn` and
`import equipop.analysis` all behave exactly as before; the only
difference is WHEN the work happens.

The reason is Stata. Every compiled library loaded into Stata's Python
is a chance for the session to fail before EquiPop is reached, and the
failure is never recognisable as ours:

  - a library built for the wrong processor stops the import dead
    (Umut's Mac, 1.37: an Intel pandas inside an Apple-Silicon Stata);
  - two copies of the same maths library in one process close Stata
    outright, with no error at all (Windows plus Anaconda, 1.35).

Until 1.37 `import equipop` loaded five compiled libraries - numpy,
pandas, scipy, pyproj and matplotlib - for a Stata command that needs
three. pyproj and matplotlib were loaded on every run by users who
never asked to project anything or draw anything, and a fault in
either took the whole package down with it. Now a broken pyproj
breaks projection and nothing else.

Keep it that way: DO NOT add a module-level `from .x import y` here.
tests/test_lazy_imports.py imports the package in a clean subprocess
and fails if any of the optional libraries arrive uninvited.

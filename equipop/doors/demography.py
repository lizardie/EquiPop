demography.py - MACHINE 4: demographic indices over k-neighbourhoods.

John's design, and his ruling that it belongs in its own machine:
machine 3 turns rasters into points, machine 4 asks a demographic
question of them.

WHAT THIS IS FOR, and it is not what WorldPop already publishes.
WorldPop ships a gridded Dependency Ratio computed FROM EACH CELL'S
OWN age structure. This computes it over THE k NEAREST THOUSAND
PEOPLE. Those are different measures: theirs describes a cell, ours
describes the population a person is actually among. A ratio over
administrative units inherits the units; a ratio over a bespoke
neighbourhood does not, and that is the whole argument.

WHAT AN INDEX IS HERE. Every one of these is a RATIO OF TWO GROUPS
counted over the same neighbourhood:

    index = (people matching the numerator) / (people matching the
             denominator), both summed over the k nearest people

so the machinery is machine 1's, with two treatment groups and a
division. Nothing new is being computed; what is new is that the
groups are named after demography rather than after columns.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT. TFR, ASFR, CBR, CDR and life expectancy
are NOT here, because they need vital events and an age-sex folder
carries stock, not flow. If a births raster is added to the folder it
becomes an ordinary column and they open up with no new machinery -
see BACKLOG 216, and read the circularity note there first.

WORLDPOP AGE BANDS ARE NOT ALL FIVE YEARS (John): 0 is under-one on
its own, 1 covers 1-4, then fives, and the last is open at 90+. Every
selector below works in BAND STARTS for that reason, never in
arithmetic on the age number.

inventory.py - WHAT IS IN A FOLDER, so a merge can be exact.

John: "could we generate a short meta text saved with each download
specifying the contents ... then the mergers can use the meta data for
dropdown menus, and the user can spend quality time on other matters."

TWO DIFFERENT OBJECTS, AND ONLY ONE BELONGS TO MACHINE 5.

The MANIFEST (equipop_fetch.json) records PROVENANCE - what was
fetched, from where, when, under which licence, with which checksum.
Machine 5 writes it and MUST NOT open the files, because opening them
is analysis and the standing rule is that a fetcher downloads and
stops (HANDOVER 13 section 3c).

The INVENTORY (equipop_inventory.json, this file) records CONTENTS -
layers, fields, CRS, geometry, extent, and the distinct values of the
columns you would actually group on. That needs the files READ, so it
belongs on the analysis side and is written once, by machine 3, the
first time a folder is seen.

THE LATTICE IS THE POINT. Two folders on the same lattice join by
integer index and the result is exact. Different lattices force a
decision - resample, or refuse - and BACKLOG 239 exists because that
decision was once made silently, merging rasters 3,300 km apart.
So the inventory GROUPS FILES BY LATTICE and says which sets can be
combined without a resample.

IT DEGRADES RATHER THAN FAILING. No rasterio, no raster detail; no
geopandas, no vector detail; an unreadable file is recorded WITH ITS
ERROR rather than skipped, because a file silently missing from an
inventory is worse than one listed as unreadable.

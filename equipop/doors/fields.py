fields.py - the names a run will produce, and what to do when the
target cannot hold them.

Every door needs these three before the engines start:

  predict_result_fields  what columns this run WILL create
  shorten_names          collision-free short forms, when asked for
  refuse_short_target    stop now, with the fix, if they will not fit

ArcGIS needs them to refuse a shapefile target BEFORE the
computation rather than after minutes of it (field finding A4).
QGIS needs them for the same reason and for one more: a Processing
algorithm must DECLARE its output columns before it runs.

The ten-character limit is not an ArcGIS quirk. It belongs to the
dBASE table inside a shapefile, so it follows the shapefile into
QGIS - where a GeoPackage plays the roomy role a file geodatabase
plays in Pro. Hence the container argument: the rule is shared, only
the name of the recommended alternative changes.

# BACKLOG 316 - KEEP BOTH
#
# John's design, session 12. The choice existed only as Overwrite or
# Stop, so running the same k twice with two different friction fields
# - walk and drive, which is the whole point of exercise 4 - could not
# be done in one file: the second run destroyed the first.
#
# IT LIVES HERE BECAUSE BOTH DOORS NEED IT, and that is the lesson of
# 320: Pro had a locale-proof number reader from 1.16.7 and QGIS never
# got one, because the code sat in the .pyt instead of in the package.
# The two doors reach the SAME implementation now.
#
# THE SHAPES OF THE PROBLEM DIFFER, though:
#   Pro appends to the input layer, so a repeated name means
#   overwriting a column that is already there - a choice the user
#   makes on the dialog.
#   QGIS writes a NEW layer each run, copying the source's fields and
#   appending the results. A repeated name there means TWO FIELDS OF
#   ONE NAME in the output, which OGR resolves however it likes. There
#   is no overwrite to choose, so keeping both is simply correct and
#   QGIS needs no box.

    second column of the same name takes a letter - the unsuffixed

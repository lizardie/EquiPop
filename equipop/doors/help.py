help.py - the explanation beside every box, written once.

Every door has to explain the same parameters, and until now each
one carried its own copy. ArcGIS Pro reads these to build the small
comment beside each box and the panel behind the '?' (through the
sidecar XML files that make_help_xml.py writes). QGIS reads the very
same strings at run time for shortHelpString. R and SPSS will read
them for their own help pages.

Keys are PARAMETER NAMES, and they are the same names in every door.
That is what keeps a dialog and its help from drifting apart: a
parameter with no entry here is caught by the test suite, in both
doors, before release.

Text moved unchanged from arcgis/make_help_xml.py in 1.18.0.

# Words that MUST differ per door (v1.29.1)
#
# Almost every box means the same thing in both doors and therefore
# takes the same sentence - that is the whole point of this file, and
# 1.29.0 was spent proving it. A handful of words are the exception:
# only the door knows what a roomy output container is called on its
# own side. Pro writes a feature class into a file geodatabase; QGIS
# writes a layer into a GeoPackage and refuses a name with no
# extension at all.
#
# So the texts carry a TOKEN and the door fills it in - the same
# mechanism fields.py has used for the refusal message since 1.18.0,
# rather than a second dictionary of QGIS wording. One text per box
# stays true, which is what 1.29.0 was for.
#
# Found by John in the field (1.29.0): the Results tooltip told a
# QGIS user to "put it in a file geodatabase", which does not exist
# there, and he reasonably read it as "you must save into a database
# first".

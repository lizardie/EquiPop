continental.py - a folder of rasters to a finished run, once.

BACKLOG 38. `bigrun` has been built and regression-tested since
v1.16.8 and was reachable only by hand-assembling a CellData.
`rasterfolder.load_folder` then gave the raster path a front door.
This is the piece between them, and it exists so that the QGIS tool
and the Pro tool are THIN - John's ruling: "one ring to rule them
all, and different doors that can use it".

Everything a door has to decide is decided HERE: which column holds
the people, whether the extent wants a tiled run, what the numbers
mean, what to refuse. A door supplies boxes and a channel; it does
not supply judgement. The doors have drifted apart three times in
this project's history and every time it was because a rule lived in
two places.

    from equipop.doors.continental import run_folder
    man = run_folder("Africa", k_values=[1000], unit_size=1000.0)

Nothing here imports QGIS or arcpy, so it is testable without either.

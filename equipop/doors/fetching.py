fetching.py - MACHINE 5: bring data in, write files, STOP.

THE STANDING RULE, HANDOVER 13 section 3c. Machines 1 to 4 give the
same answers offline, forever. A downloader cannot: the service may be
down, estimates get revised, the API changes on the provider's
schedule. Put a Download button inside an analysis tool and the whole
tool loses reproducibility.

So a fetcher DOWNLOADS INTO A FOLDER, WRITES A MANIFEST, AND ENDS.
Machine 3 then reads that folder exactly as it reads any other, and
machines 1, 2 and 4 never learn that WorldPop exists.

THE MANIFEST IS THE DELIVERABLE, NOT THE FILES. Without a product
version, a fetch date and a checksum, a downloaded raster is LESS
reproducible than one a colleague emailed. WorldPop's API returns doi,
citation and licence, so none of that is invented here - it is
recorded from what the provider states.

NOTHING IS OVERWRITTEN (John's ruling). A file already present whose
checksum differs stops the run and is named. A quiet overwrite is how
a reproducible run becomes unreproducible with nobody noticing.

NOT equipop/fetch.py. That is the original spec's single-URL helper -
give it a URL, get a local path, with caching. It stays as it is and
is still exported. This module is the other thing: resolve a REQUEST
against a provider's catalogue, fetch a SET, and record what happened.

THE PROVIDER IS A SMALL ADAPTER, so a second source is an adapter and
not a second machine - John's point that this pattern should bring
other web resources in.

    TWO THINGS THAT RESPONSE SETTLED.

    FIRST, EVERY RESOURCE CARRIES AN MD5 IN `hash`. Like Geofabrik,
    that lets a download be checked against WHAT THE PUBLISHER SAYS
    THE FILE IS, not merely against the bytes that arrived. Two
    providers now offer this and WorldPop does not.

    SECOND, AND IT BREAKS AN ASSUMPTION: HDX LICENCES ARE OFTEN NOT
    MACHINE-READABLE. The IATI dataset returns license_id
    "hdx-other", license_title "Other" and a PROSE license_other
    pointing at a web page. So `may_redistribute` and `share_alike`
    CANNOT be derived for many HDX datasets, and guessing would be
    worse than admitting it. Where the licence is a known open one
    they are set; otherwise they are None and the prose is carried
    verbatim for a human to read.

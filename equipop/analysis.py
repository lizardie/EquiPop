"""
analysis.py - the radial k-NN engine (Phase 1 + decay).

Core idea (from the EquiPop papers): on a uniform grid, the relative
distances from ANY origin cell to its surrounding cells are always the
same. So we compute ONE list of cell-offsets sorted by distance, and
reuse it for every origin. Cells at identical distance form a "ring".

Decay: when a Decay object is passed, every neighbour's contribution
is ALSO accumulated multiplied by weight(distance). The k-thresholds
are still defined by the RAW (unweighted) counts - the decayed values
are simply recorded at the same moment, exactly as in the original
EquiPop ("decayed variables use the same k-values as the non-decaying
variables"). Decayed counts are therefore always <= raw counts.

Output naming - two schemes, chosen with naming="short" | "legacy":

    Radial k-NN analysis for every populated cell.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cells : DataFrame with one row per grid cell ('E_grid', 'N_grid',
            a total-count column, a treatment-count column).
    k_values : the k thresholds, e.g. [50, 100, 200, 400, 800].
    unit_size : grid size in metres.
    max_radius_units : search limit in grid units; unreached ks get
            partial results (mirrors original EquiPop behaviour).
    tie_mode : "ring" (default) adds all equidistant cells before
            checking thresholds; "sequential" checks after every
            single cell (original EquiPop, order-dependent).
    decay : a Decay object, e.g. Decay(half_life_m=8000), or None.
    naming : "short" (N_50, T_50, R_50, ...) or
             "legacy" (IntervalSumCountAll_50, ...).
    self_potential : how far away what is LOCAL - what the origin's own
            cell already holds - is treated as being, 0 to 1 (BACKLOG
            95, and 153). RULED by John, 1.29.7: this engine gets the
            SAME rule as run_knn_counts and run_knn_stats, so "two
            engines, one mathematics" is true again. Until then this
            function put its own cell at distance zero and reported
            Dist_k = 0 wherever one cell already held k - while the
            newer engines reported the equal-area radius for the same
            data. The manuals teach with THIS function, so a reader
            following them got one number and the QGIS door gave
            another.
    seed : only used with tie_mode="sequential": shuffles the (otherwise
           arbitrary) within-ring visiting order reproducibly. Record it
           in the run's metadata log. None keeps the construction order.

    Returns
    -------
    One row per origin cell. Fixed columns: Id, EastWest, NorthSouth,
    CountAllLocal, CountGroupLocal, SumCountAll, SumCountGroup, Ratio,
    MaxDistance. Per-k columns as per the chosen naming scheme.

    """
    Radial k-NN analysis with user-selected statistics per variable.

    self_potential : how far away your OWN cell's people are, 0 to 1
    (v1.29.5, BACKLOG 95). Must match run_knn_counts exactly - the two
    engines are bound by regression test. See equipop/selfpot.py.

    The user switches statistics on per FUNCTION (applied to all k),
    exactly as requested:

        stats = {
            "HighEdu": ["ratio", "sd", "se", "entropy", "gini"],  # binary
            "ForvInk": ["mean", "median", "sd", "se", "gini"],    # value
        }

    Whether a variable is binary (tier 1, exact from counts) or
    continuous (tiers 2/3, from stored individual values) is decided
    by how it was declared in build_cells().

    Engine note: this function uses a distance-sort core rather than
    the ring-expansion core of run_knn(). For the radial (no-friction)
    model the two are MATHEMATICALLY IDENTICAL - cells at equal
    distance are still processed as one atomic ring - but the sort
    core is much faster when populated cells are sparse. The
    ring-expansion core remains the basis for the future friction
    model, where visiting order genuinely depends on the path.

    Output columns
    --------------
    EastWest, NorthSouth, N_local, plus per k:
      N_{k}, Dist_{k},
      per binary var+stat:  e.g. R_HighEdu_{k}, Gini_HighEdu_{k}
      per value  var+stat:  e.g. Mean_ForvInk_{k}, Med_ForvInk_{k}
      per value  var:       Nv_{var}_{k} (count of valid values)
    Unreached k-levels receive partial results, as in run_knn().

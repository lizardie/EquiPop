"""
cells.py - build cell-level data from INDIVIDUAL-level rows.

This is the entry point for "tier 3" data: one row per individual,
where several individuals may share the same coordinate. The builder
aggregates them into grid cells while keeping, per cell:

  - n            : the individual count (this is what k counts!)
  - binary sums  : one running sum per binary variable (0/1)
  - value arrays : the raw individual values per continuous variable
                   (needed for exact median / Gini at k-level)

Missing handling (spec section 12):
  - rows with missing coordinates are DROPPED with a printed warning
  - missing values in a continuous variable: the individual still
    counts towards k, but contributes no value to that variable's
    statistics (a separate valid-n is reported as Nv_<var>_<k>)

# EquiPop for ArcGIS Pro - setup and first run

*Pro only (Python 3). Ten minutes the first time, zero thereafter.*

## 1. One-time: give Pro's Python the EquiPop package

ArcGIS Pro ships its own Python inside a conda environment, and the
default one is locked. The supported route is a clone:

1. In Pro: **Project -> Package Manager** (older versions: Python tab)
   -> **Environment Manager** -> select `arcgispro-py3` -> **Clone**.
   Name it e.g. `arcgispro-equipop`. (A few minutes.)
2. **Activate** the clone in the same dialog, restart Pro when asked.
3. Start menu -> ArcGIS -> **Python Command Prompt** (it opens inside
   the ACTIVE environment) and run:

       pip install equipop

4. **pyproj, which Pro does not ship.** EquiPop requires it, and the
   installs that use `--no-deps` (to stop pip upgrading Pro's own
   numpy and scipy) skip it. Easiest route, no command line:
   **Project → Package Manager → Add Packages → pyproj**, with the
   clone active. Or in the same Python Command Prompt:

       pip install pyproj

   **Do not add `--user`.** It puts packages in
   `AppData\Roaming\Python`, which Pro never reads — see the
   stowaway check in §6. (`--user` IS the right route for QGIS's
   OSGeo4W shell, which has no clone; the two hosts differ here and
   INSTALL.md gives each its own line.)

5. Check: `python -c "import equipop, pyproj; print(equipop.__version__)"`

### Files to copy (v1.47.11)

**SIX files must sit together in one folder** (e.g. `C:\Data\EQP`),
and all six must come from THE SAME RELEASE:

    EquiPop.pyt                          the toolbox
    EquiPop.CountsShares.pyt.xml         help for machine 1
    EquiPop.ValueStatistics.pyt.xml      help for machine 2
    EquiPop.ContinentalRasters.pyt.xml   help for machine 3
    EquiPop.SpatialDemography.pyt.xml    help for machine 4
    EquiPop.FolderInventory.pyt.xml      help for machine 6

The last THREE are new in v1.47.11. Machines 3 and 4 had no help file
at all before it, which is why their '?' page said "There is no
description for this item" and every parameter said "There is no
explanation for this parameter"; machine 6 is new in this release.

Two more travel with them and live wherever you keep them:

    ARCGIS_GUIDE.md                 this file
    make_help_xml.py                regenerates the two .xml files

REPLACE ALL SIX TOGETHER, EVERY TIME. The .xml files are what puts
the small explanation beside each parameter box, and they are written
from the toolbox's own parameter list. Keep an old .xml beside a new
.pyt and every box added since that .xml was made has NO COMMENT AT
ALL, while the older boxes look perfectly normal - so nothing seems
wrong except one silent gap.

That is not hypothetical. It is how v1.47.11's new box, *Is a place
its own neighbour?*, arrived with an empty flyout in a real
installation: the .pyt was replaced and the sidecars were not. This
paragraph exists because an earlier version of it said "FOUR files"
and then listed three.

If you ever need to rebuild the sidecars yourself - after any change
to the toolbox - run `make_help_xml.py`. It works in two places and
nowhere else:

    Python Command Prompt      cd C:\Data\EQP
    (Start menu -> ArcGIS)     python make_help_xml.py

    repository root            python arcgis/make_help_xml.py

**Pro caches toolbox MODULES, not just their listing. RESTART PRO
after replacing the files** - removing the toolbox from the project
and adding it back does NOT reload a cached module, and you will go
on running the old code while the new file sits on disk. From
v1.47.12 every run opens by naming the toolbox and package versions,
so you can always see which is live.

### If the flyout beside a box shows literal `<p>` tags

v1.47.11 writes the parameter comments as escaped HTML paragraphs.
That is an attempt at a long-standing problem - the Explanation
column of the '?' help page has always come up blank even though the
same text renders fine in the dialog - and it is NOT CONFIRMED to
work. If it misfires you will see the tags themselves. Undo it in ten seconds.

**Use the Python Command Prompt, not Pro's Python window.** Start
menu -> ArcGIS -> *Python Command Prompt* (it opens inside your
active clone). Pro's embedded Python WINDOW is already an
interpreter, so typing `python ...` there is a syntax error:

    cd C:\Data\EQP
    python make_help_xml.py --plain

That writes both .xml files beside the toolbox. Nothing else
changes.

(Before v1.47.11 this script could not run from your folder at all -
it needed a file from the repository's `tests/` directory. It now
uses Pro's own arcpy instead, which is why the Python Command Prompt
is the place to run it.)

## 2. Add the toolbox to a project

Copy the `arcgis/EquiPop.pyt` file anywhere convenient (it can live
in the project folder). In Pro's **Catalog** pane: right-click
**Toolboxes -> Add Toolbox** -> pick the .pyt. FIVE tools appear
under "EquiPop": *Counts and Shares*, *Value Statistics*, *Raster
Data Curation*, *Spatial Demographic Analysis* and *What is in this
folder?*. All five have in-dialog help and a '?' page.

## 3. First run (Counts and Shares)

Open **1. Counts and Shares**, pick your point layer of people,
choose a 0/1 group field, type `200 1600` under k, optionally a
decay half-life like `3000`, and run. New double fields appear on
the layer: `N_200`, `R_<group>_200`, `Dist_200`, ... and `ND_inf`
if decay was on - ready for **Symbology** or a join. Rows without
geometry get Null, as they should.

Tool 2 does income: pick numeric fields, statistics `mean median
gini`, k - fields like `Med_income_400` and `Gini_income_400`
appear. Tool 3 takes a barrier csv (`x,y,friction` in the SAME
metric coordinate system as the layer) and returns `Rounds_k` and
`N_tau...` isochrone counts.

## 4. Three things worth knowing

- **File geodatabase beats shapefile**: shapefiles truncate field
  names to 10 characters; the tool warns, but a gdb layer is the
  honest home for `Gini_income_400`.
- **Metric coordinates required** (metres - SWEREF 99, UTM...), the
  book's chapter 3 rule; reproject with Pro's Project tool first if
  needed.
- **Re-running**: results are appended; re-running with the same
  parameters overwrites those fields via the join. Different k
  values simply add more fields.

## 5. When something fails

"No module named equipop" -> Pro is not using your clone: Package
Manager, activate the clone, restart. Anything else -> the message
window shows the package's own loud diagnostics; copy them to the
maintainers (or to Claude) verbatim.


## 6. Troubleshooting - the field-tested ladder (v1.14)

Every step below was walked in a real failing installation; walk it
in order.

1. **Which Python is Pro using?** Python window:
   `import sys; print(sys.exec_prefix)` - NOT sys.executable, which
   in Pro's embedded window is ArcGISPro.exe itself (using it for
   pip LAUNCHES A SECOND PRO - do not ask how we know). The prefix
   must end in your CLONE's name; `arcgispro-py3` means the clone is
   not active: Environment Manager -> activate -> full Pro restart.
2. **The stowaway check.** `pip show equipop` may claim the package
   exists while Pro cannot import it: read the **Location** line. If
   it says `AppData\Roaming\Python\...` the package was stranded by
   pip's silent "user installation" fallback in a folder Pro NEVER
   READS. Evict and reinstall with the fallback disabled:

       import sys, os, subprocess
       py = os.path.join(sys.exec_prefix, "python.exe")
       env = dict(os.environ, PYTHONNOUSERSITE="1")
       subprocess.run([py, "-m", "pip", "uninstall", "-y", "equipop"])
       subprocess.run([py, "-m", "pip", "install", "equipop"],
                      env=env)

   Restart Pro (it binds packages at startup).
3. **Version check.** `import equipop; print(equipop.__version__)` -
   the toolbox needs >= 1.14.0 for the category mode and output
   options.

## 7. Reading the results honestly

- `Dist_k` is in METRES and that is the point: it is the radius each
  point needed to gather its k persons - k fixes the population, the
  geography floats. The tool prints this reminder whenever the
  column appears.
- If a share exceeds 1 or N looks smaller than T, the group field
  holds COUNTS while the Population field was left empty - the tool
  now prints a hint the moment it sees that pattern. Set Population
  to the total-persons field.
- Category mode: rows outside the population filter get Null in
  every result column - they were not part of the analysis, and
  Null says so.


## 8. v1.15 - two tools, several rulers

Machine 3 is retired - not removed, PROMOTED: friction and terrain
are now DISTANCE INGREDIENTS on tool 1. Add a barrier table (ANY
table Pro can open - gdb, dbf, csv, registered txt; coordinate
columns found by name automatically: x/y, East/North, POINT_X/Y...)
and/or a DEM raster, and the same counts-and-shares analysis runs on
the effort ruler: Rounds_k and N_tau# columns appear, the effort
dials reveal themselves, and - the point of the redesign - your
populations, groups, categories and weights all work ACROSS THE
WATER exactly as on flat ground. Both ingredients together = rivers
AND hills in one run. Runtime note: the effort engines cost real
time on large layers; the tool says so when they engage.

Rivers as LINES: in Python, `equipop.friction.features_to_friction`
turns line/polygon features with a friction field into the barrier
table (overlaps stack additively); a one-click Pro wrapper for it is
on the roadmap.


## 9. v1.16 - the GIS input rework (what changed for you)

**Coordinates come from the data, not from column names.** Point
layers are read straight from their geometry - no X/Y columns are
ever required. Plain tables (CSV, Excel, gdb tables) get their
coordinate fields guessed and pre-filled, and you can always
override the guess. Nothing ever asks you to rename a column.

**Coordinates must be metric.** Degree data is refused with the
projection that FITS your data computed from its own extent (Uppsala
gets SWEREF 99 TM, Kayseri gets UTM zone 36N). If you tick
*Auto-project degree data*, a LAYER is instead read on the fly in
that projection - your stored data is untouched, and the messages
say which CRS was used. A plain table cannot be auto-projected: its
numbers carry no CRS to project from.

**Barriers are geometry-aware.** One input accepts a point, line or
polygon layer, a table of cells, or a raster. Lines charge every
grid cell they genuinely cross, polygons every cell they cover
(holes and multipart handled), rasters are sampled at analysis-cell
midpoints with NoData and zero costing nothing. Where features share
a cell the *overlap rule* decides: additive by default (a river
crossed at a railway costs both), or max / min / mean.

**Machine 2 knows about population.** Set the full-population field
and k counts PERSONS - the median, the Gini and every percentile are
population-weighted, exactly, by expanding rows to persons. Tick
only the measures you want; only those are computed. Nv_<field>_k
always reports how many neighbours actually had a value.

**Output.** Results append to the input layer, or go to a new
feature class, or - for table inputs - to a .csv carrying your
coordinates and the original row order. Shapefiles cap field names
at 10 characters, so long result names are refused BEFORE the run
with advice; a file geodatabase has no such limit. If you tick
*Allow shortened field names*, names are shortened without ever
colliding and the mapping is printed and saved beside the output.

**Re-running is safe.** Fields that already exist are updated in
place, so nothing is deleted and a map layer never loses sight of
its own file. After writing, the tool re-reads the target and tells
you which fields really arrived, naming the dataset.

**Every run leaves a manifest** - `<output>_EquiPop_run.csv` - with
the EquiPop version, the working CRS (and whether it was
auto-projected), every parameter, the row and cell counts and the
per-stage timings. Keep it with the results and the run is
reproducible a year later.

### Reading the timings
The messages pane now shows where the time went:

    [time] reading input: 0.9 s
    [time] calculating: 4 min 44 s
    [time] writing results to the layer: 1 min 49 s
    [time] TOTAL: 6 min 58 s - most of it in 'calculating'

The package's own notes appear too (`[fast]`, `[stats]`, `[cells]`).
Two lines are worth understanding:

- `fast pass with m = N neighbour cells` - how many cells each origin
  looked at. It affects SPEED ONLY: any origin not settled inside
  that neighbourhood is recomputed exactly.
- `N sparse origins need a wider search` - thin-population origins
  climbing to a wider search. A handful is normal; a storm of them
  usually means a decay run whose truncation distance is large.

**The strongest speed control is yours: cell size.** Doubling it
quarters the number of origins. For decay runs, the *decay cutoff*
box is the second: 1e-6 (default) reaches about 20 half-lives, 1e-3
about 10 and runs roughly four times faster.

### Scale ceilings, honestly
Plain counts and statistics run comfortably at national scale (475k
points, k=444 with a radius: about a minute of calculation). The
EFFORT engines - barriers and DEM - are different: they build a
movement graph over the whole bounding box, empty ground included,
so they suit a bounded study area rather than a country at 100 m.
The tool estimates the memory first and tells you what to change.

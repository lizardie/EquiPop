EquiPop.pyt - EquiPop for ArcGIS Pro. Python 3 / Pro only.

THE DISCIPLINE (same as the Stata bridge): this file is GLUE ONLY.
Every computation lives in the pip-installed `equipop` package, where
the automatic test suite guards it; the toolbox merely moves arrays
between ArcGIS and the package. The glue itself is validated against
a simulated arcpy before every release.

Install (once): ArcGIS Pro -> Package Manager -> clone the default
environment, activate the clone, then in its Python Command Prompt:
    pip install equipop
Add this .pyt to any project via Catalog -> Toolboxes -> Add Toolbox.
Full walk-through in ARCGIS_GUIDE.md next to this file.

Tools:
  1 Counts & Shares  - k / radius neighbourhoods, group shares,
                       decay; barriers (point/line/polygon/raster/
                       table) and DEM as DISTANCE INGREDIENTS
  2 Value Statistics - selectable statistics of numeric fields
                       among the k nearest PERSONS (full-population
                       aware)

v1.18 SHARED CORE: the parts every door needs - the help text, the
forwarding of the package's printed voice into the pane, the result
column names, and the coordinate rules - moved into the package
(equipop.doors) so the QGIS, R and SPSS doors inherit them instead
of rebuilding them. This file kept its behaviour exactly; it now
calls the shared versions. It declares _CONTRACT below: if the
installed package outgrows it, the door says so and names the fix.
The package is still imported LAZILY, inside functions, so the
toolbox opens in Pro even when equipop is not installed.

v1.16 GIS INPUT REWORK: both machines share one loader. Spatial
inputs are read FROM GEOMETRY (no X/Y attribute columns needed,
ever); plain tables get guessed-but-overridable X and Y fields;
degree CRS refused loudly; line/polygon/raster barriers map to every
grid cell they genuinely touch. Results append to point layers as
row-aligned double fields (Null where coordinates are missing);
table inputs write a NEW output table.

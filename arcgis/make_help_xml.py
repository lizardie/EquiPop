"""Generate ArcGIS Pro sidecar help for EquiPop.pyt (v1.16.3).

Pro shows two kinds of help in a tool dialog: the small comment
beside each parameter box, and the larger panel behind the '?'.
Both come from metadata XML files that live NEXT TO the toolbox -
EquiPop.<ToolName>.pyt.xml - so nothing is fetched from the web.

Run this file from the repo root to regenerate them:
    python arcgis/make_help_xml.py
    python arcgis/make_help_xml.py --out DIR   # write elsewhere

BACKLOG 45: --out exists because the SUITE used to call this with no
way to say where, so `pytest` left two untracked .pyt.xml files in
`arcgis/` every time it ran. A test that modifies the working tree it
is testing is a test that can hide a change - and these are build
outputs, neither committed nor shipped, so the repo only ever held
them by accident.
The parameter NAMES are read from the toolbox itself (through the
test harness's simulated arcpy), so the help can never drift from
the dialog.

The TEXT itself lives in the package, in equipop.doors.help, because
QGIS, R and SPSS need the very same sentences. This file only turns
it into the XML that Pro expects (v1.18.0).

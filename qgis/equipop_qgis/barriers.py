barriers.py - barriers and terrain, QGIS side.

A barrier turns plain distance into EFFORT: a river, a railway, a
lake or a steep slope makes the people on the other side farther
away in rounds rather than in metres. The engine that does this is
shared and already tested; what QGIS has to supply is the geometry,
read its own way.

That is the whole of this file. `points_to_friction`,
`paths_to_friction` and `raster_to_friction` take plain coordinate
lists and numbers - no arcpy, no PyQGIS - so the barrier arithmetic
is identical in both doors by construction, not by care.

One QGIS-specific duty: reprojecting. A barrier layer may be in a
different CRS from the points, and every coordinate must arrive in
the working CRS of the run or the barrier lands in the wrong place -
silently, and plausibly.

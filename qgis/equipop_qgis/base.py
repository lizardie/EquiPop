base.py - what both QGIS algorithms share.

Almost nothing here is new. The help text, the reporting, the result
column names and the coordinate rules all come from equipop.doors,
which the ArcGIS door already uses - that is what the shared core was
built for in 1.18.0. What is genuinely QGIS's own is reading features
from a QgsFeatureSource and writing them to a QgsFeatureSink, and
that is all this file really adds.

Parameter names deliberately MATCH the ArcGIS toolbox: `layer`, `k`,
`pop`, `treat`, `unit` and so on. The shared help is keyed by
parameter name, so identical names mean both doors explain
themselves with identical words - which is the point for teaching,
where a QGIS student and a Pro student should recognise each other's
screens.

        Measured by John on the real file, QGIS 3.42.1: 8,730 Malta
        POIs carrying 31 fields - four original plus result columns
        from earlier runs - took 5.40 s that way against 1.00 s this
        way. 270,630 attributes() calls became 8,730, and 8.4 million
        value conversions became 270,630, of which none are thrown
        away. The whole read fell from 5.56 s to 1.17 s.

        Worth keeping in mind WHY it grew: every run appends result
        columns to the layer, so each run made the next one slower,
        squared. Materialising the features was never the problem -
        that was 0.11 s, so the GeoPackage was innocent all along,
        which is not what BACKLOG 68 assumed.

alg_fetch.py - MACHINE 5's QGIS door: bring data in, and STOP.

THE STANDING RULE, HANDOVER 13 section 3c. This tool downloads into a
folder, writes a manifest, and ends. It produces NO LAYER, on purpose:
the moment a fetching tool also analyses, every result computed
through it stops being reproducible offline.

So the output is a FOLDER, not a feature sink - which is unusual for a
Processing algorithm and is the point. Machine 3 reads that folder
afterwards, exactly as it reads any other.

AND IT ASKS BEFORE IT ACTS. "Download" is off by default. Run it once
to see what WOULD be fetched - how many files, from where, under which
licence - and only then tick the box. The download leg has never run
in EquiPop's development environment, because every WorldPop host is
blocked there, so the first thing a user meets must be inspectable.

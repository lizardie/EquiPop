alg_continental.py - the QGIS door onto a folder of rasters.

BACKLOG 38. Deliberately THIN. Every decision about what a
continental run means lives in equipop.doors.continental.run_folder,
which the ArcGIS tool calls with the same arguments - John's ruling,
"one ring to rule them all, and different doors that can use it". The
doors in this project have drifted apart three times, and every time
it was because a rule lived in two places.

So what is genuinely QGIS's own here, and all this file adds: turning
Processing parameters into keyword arguments, and turning the result
table into a QgsFeatureSink.

Parameter names match the ArcGIS toolbox on purpose, so the shared
help explains both screens with identical words.

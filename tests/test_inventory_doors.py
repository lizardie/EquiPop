"""test_inventory_doors.py - MACHINE 6 AT BOTH DOORS (BACKLOG 269).

The engine shipped in 1.45.0 with no door of any kind: no GUI, no
runner, no Stata. It was reachable only by writing Python, which the
person this project is built for does not do. These tests drive the
two doors the way a user does and check the TABLE THAT COMES BACK,
not the call.

Each was verified by breaking it on purpose:

  * the lattice column dropped from COLUMNS        -> 1, 4 fail
  * _rows() reading rec["path"] (the shape the
    first draft invented) instead of rec["file"]   -> 2 fails
  * the multi-lattice warning removed              -> 4 fails
  * addFeature's return discarded in the door      -> 5 fails
  * the Pro row builder drifting from the QGIS one -> 6 fails

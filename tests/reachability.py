"""reachability.py - WHAT CAN A PERSON ACTUALLY REACH, AND FROM WHERE?

John's request, session 12, after five things were found in one
session that were built, tested, and reachable by nobody:

    inventory.py         shipped 1.45.0, no door of any kind
    vectorjoin.py        only from a script the sdist did not carry
    RunLog (meta.py)     backlog item 2, called by nothing
    the Pro help sidecars  generated, tested, never shipped
    make_help_xml.py     shipped since 1.44.4, could not run where

EVERY ONE PASSED ITS TESTS. The suite asked whether the thing worked
and never whether anyone could get to it. This file asks the second
question.

WHY IT IS DECLARED RATHER THAN DERIVED. The first attempt grepped
each door for the engine function it calls. It was wrong in BOTH
directions: it reported machine 1 as absent from QGIS and Pro,
because both reach it through `stata_bridge.dispatch` rather than by
name, and it reported the lattice join as present in QGIS because
`alg_continental.py` imports `join_to_points` for something else
entirely. A matrix that guesses is worse than none - it would have
said the doors were fine.

So the truth is WRITTEN DOWN HERE and the test CHECKS THE WRITING:
every piece of evidence must still exist in the file it names, and
every module in the package must appear somewhere below. A new
capability cannot be added without either naming its doors or
recording, in words, why it has none.

THE HONEST PART IS `NO_DOOR`. It is not a failure state. Plenty of
things legitimately have no GUI - John ruled in session 12 that
machine 2 needs no Stata door because Stata does weighted statistics
natively and better. What is NOT allowed is silence. Each NO_DOOR
carries a reason and, where one exists, a backlog number.
"""

#: (file, symbol) - the test fails if the symbol leaves the file, so
#: the matrix cannot quietly go stale the way the priority list did.
def door(path, symbol):
    return ("door", path, symbol)


#: No door, on purpose or not yet. `why` is prose, `item` is the
#: backlog number if one exists.
def no_door(why, item=None):
    return ("none", why, item)


def same_as(other_door, extra=""):
    """No door, for the SAME reason another door has none.

    Written as a reference the test RESOLVES, not as the words "As
    QGIS" - which is what the first draft used and which tells a
    future session nothing it can act on. The resolved reason is what
    gets checked, so a cross-reference cannot be a way of writing
    less than a reason.

"""MACHINE 5's QGIS door, EXECUTED.

Every QGIS door in this project has shipped with a wiring fault that
construction could not see - self.check_versions, a bare int for a WKB
type, a package import in initAlgorithm, parameterAsEnum missing from
the simulator. So this one calls processAlgorithm from the first
commit.

It also has to be checked for something the others do not: THAT IT
NEVER ANALYSES. The standing rule is that a fetching tool downloads,
writes a manifest and stops, because a tool that also computes makes
every result taken through it unreproducible offline.

"""MACHINE 4 - demographic indices over k-neighbourhoods.

The arithmetic is machine 1's; what is new is that the groups are
named after demography. So most of what can go wrong here is CHOOSING
THE WRONG COLUMNS, and that is what these tests are about.

THE TRAP THROUGHOUT IS THAT WORLDPOP'S AGE BANDS ARE NOT ALL FIVE
YEARS (John): 0 is under-one alone, 1 covers 1-4, then fives, and 90
is open-ended. Any selector doing arithmetic on the age NUMBER rather
than working in band starts gets "15 to 49" wrong at both ends.

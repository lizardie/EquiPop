"""
qgis_stub.py - a simulated PyQGIS, so the QGIS door can be tested in
CI where qgis.core cannot be pip-installed.

Built to the same doctrine as the fake arcpy in test_arcgis_stub.py,
including its limits, which are worth stating plainly:

    THE SIMULATOR PROVES LOGIC. ONLY THE FIELD PROVES BEHAVIOUR.

Everything the ArcGIS round learned the hard way was invisible to a
simulator - file locks, cached schemas, a parameter type that
crashed the host outright. The QGIS equivalents will be invisible
here too. What this DOES prove: that parameters are declared, that
coordinates are read and reprojected, that the result columns are
built and written in the right order, that refusals are raised as
the host's own exception type, and that the numbers match the
Python core. That is most of a door, and none of its behaviour.

Only the parts of PyQGIS the door actually touches are simulated.

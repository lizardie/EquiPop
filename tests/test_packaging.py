This file exists because of a bug that could not fail inside the
repository. `load("gridby")` - the first line of the Book's chapter
1 - reached out to ../examples and ../tests. Both are there in a git
clone and in the source archive, and neither is in a wheel, so every
student who installed EquiPop from PyPI got ModuleNotFoundError on
their first command. The test suite could never have caught it,
because the test suite runs inside the repository, where the folders
are right there.

So these tests check the SHAPE of what gets installed rather than
behaviour: nothing the package needs at run time may live outside
the package, and anything added to equipop/data must be declared or
it will silently not travel.

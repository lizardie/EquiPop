"""test_selfpot.py - SELF-POTENTIAL (BACKLOG 95), the self-calibration
substitution (96) and the N_k overshoot report (94).

Every test here was checked by BREAKING THE RULE ON PURPOSE and
watching it fail; a test that cannot fail is not a test. The
deliberate breakages used were:

  * radius_for_k() returning 0.0            -> 1, 2, 3, 4 fail
  * dropping the dw[0] substitution in the
    decay branch of fastcounts               -> 5 fails
  * dispatch() swallowing self_potential
    into **extra instead of passing it on    -> 6 fails
  * restoring the old silent np.where()      -> 7 fails
  * removing the overshoot counter           -> 8 fails

"""The QGIS door, against a simulated PyQGIS.

Same doctrine as the ArcGIS suite: this proves LOGIC. Only QGIS on a
real machine proves behaviour, and the ArcGIS round showed that the
gap between those two is where all the interesting bugs live.

The test that matters most is the conformance one. Gridby's planted
truths say a door is sane; the shared reference says two doors
AGREE - which is what a student needs, since a QGIS class and a Pro

    truncating alike - PROVIDED it is handed the suffixed name.
    Shorten first and the suffix is cut away into a silent

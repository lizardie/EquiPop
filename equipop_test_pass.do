*! EquiPop 1.49.1 - a test pass over stata_test_data.dta
*!
*! WHAT CHANGED IN 1.40.5, and why it matters:
*!   Until now this file STATED its invariants and did not ENFORCE
*!   them. A wrong number printed itself and the run carried on, so
*!   the pass could only fail in front of somebody reading closely.
*!   Every stated property is now a CHECK with a verdict, and the
*!   file refuses to finish quietly if any check failed.
*!
*! HOW TO READ THE OUTPUT
*!   Every check prints one line beginning [ok] or [FAIL].
*!   The last thing the pass prints is a VERDICT with a count.
*!   If you send us only one thing, send the whole log; if you can
*!   send only one screen, send the verdict.
*!
*! A FAILING CHECK DOES NOT STOP THE PASS. Each block is trapped, so
*! one broken thing cannot hide the other twenty-two. A single run
*! gives the complete picture.
*!
*! WHAT THIS DATA IS: 10,892 points on a metric grid (X 503-537 km,
*! Y 442-484 km - about 34 by 42 km). LowEdu, HighEdu, TheoEdu and
*! VocaEdu are 0/1 MARKERS, not counts. ValCount is a count per point,
*! 0-98, mean 45.5. ValFloat is continuous, 0-23,254.
*! NINE rows have no coordinates. They receive missing results, and
*! block 1 checks that they do.
*!
*! READ THIS BEFORE BLOCK 7: because the education variables are 0/1
*! markers, any run that ALSO supplies a population needs
*! treatmode(flags). Block 7 runs both settings side by side so the
*! size of the error is visible.
*!
*! WHERE THE EXPECTED NUMBERS COME FROM: every threshold below was
*! measured against this dataset through equipop/stata_bridge.py, the
*! same code the .ado calls. They are not guesses and they are not
*! carried over from an earlier version of this file.

* ==================================================================
* 4. Both at once - k and r in the same run.
*     EXPECT THREE new columns, not four. CORRECTED IN 1.40.6, after
*     the 1.40.5 field run failed this check on John's machine.
*
*     The reason is the whole shape of the method. The two machines
*     are INVERSES of one another:
*        k asks for a number of PEOPLE, and the distance you must
*          travel to reach them is the ANSWER - so Dist_200 exists;
*        r gives the DISTANCE, and the number of people inside it is
*          the answer - so there is nothing left for a Dist_r2000 to
*          report. It could only ever hold 2000, the number you
*          typed in yourself.
*     So k(200) r(2000) yields N_200, Dist_200 and N_r2000. The
*     contract is stated at equipop/stata_bridge.py line 355:
*     r_values -> N_r<r>, T_<v>_r<r>, R_<v>_r<r>.
*
*     The 1.40.5 check asked for a fourth column because the wording
*     "four new columns" was carried across from an older version of
*     this file and never measured - the exact fault this file's own
*     header warns about. The engine was right; the pass was wrong.
*     ALSO EXPECT: N_r2000 far more variable than N_200, which is
*     fixed by construction.

* 17. A DIFFERENT CURVE, and the thing about it that is easy to get
*     backwards. CORRECTED IN 1.40.5: the previous version of this
*     block asserted the opposite, and nobody had ever computed it.
*
*     Both models are 0.5 at the half-life BY CONSTRUCTION, so that
*     distance is where they cross. Their shapes differ either side
*     of it. With a half-life of 800 m:
*        negexp  at   50 m = 0.958,   at 3200 m = 0.063
*        power   at   50 m = 0.665,   at 3200 m = 0.433
*     power is the HARSHER curve inside the half-life and the gentler
*     one outside it. "Distant places never quite stop counting" is a
*     statement about the TAIL, and it does not by itself say which
*     model keeps more mass.
*
*     Which one keeps more depends on where the NEIGHBOURHOOD sits
*     relative to the bandwidth you chose. Here a k=300 neighbourhood
*     has a median radius of 48 m against a half-life of 800 m, so it
*     lies almost entirely on the side where power cuts harder.
*     EXPECT: on every row whose whole neighbourhood is inside the
*     half-life, power's ND_300 is BELOW negexp's. On this data that
*     is 10,743 rows, with no exceptions.
*     The reverse is NOT a clean rule and is not asserted: Dist is the
*     distance to the FURTHEST neighbour, so a row can reach past the
*     half-life while most of its 300 people are still well inside.

* 20. MISSING-VALUE CODES. REBUILT IN 1.40.5.
*
*     The previous version declared missing(0) on ValFloat and fed it
*     to treat(). The guard was right to refuse that, and the refusal
*     halted the pass here - which is why blocks 21 and 22 have never
*     run in the field at all. ValFloat is a CONTINUOUS magnitude
*     running to 23,254, while the population at a point tops out at
*     98. treat() holds a number of PEOPLE, and a share is only a
*     share when numerator and denominator are counted in the same
*     units. A magnitude divided by a headcount is not bounded by one
*     and is not a share of anything. A continuous measure belongs in
*     machine 2 - mean, median, quantiles, Gini over the
*     neighbourhood - not in treat().
*
*     So this block now builds a genuine COUNT column. Grp is half
*     the population at each point, which can never exceed it, and
*     every twelfth row carries the sentinel -999 meaning NO DATA.
*     Every twelfth is deliberate rather than random, so the count is
*     identical on every machine and every Stata version.
*
*     EXPECT: exactly 907 sentinel rows; the run reports how many
*     values it blanked; blanked places still count as PEOPLE towards
*     k and still receive their own results; and the share divides by
*     the people actually OBSERVED, so it sits just under 0.5 rather
*     than being dragged down by the blanked cases. Mean about 0.494.
*     Also shows [if], which restricts the ROWS THAT GET RESULTS, not
*     the people who count as neighbours.

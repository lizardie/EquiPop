"""make_sthlp.py - Stata's help file, from the same text as every
other door.

BACKLOG 175. `help equipop` failed until 1.36 - the first thing a
Stata user types, and there was nothing to find.

The text is NOT written here. It comes from equipop/doors/help.py,
which ArcGIS Pro reads through make_help_xml.py and QGIS reads at run
time for shortHelpString. One source, four doors. When projection
lands, its sentences are written once in help.py and appear in the
Stata help, the Pro panel and the QGIS dialog together - which is the
condition John set when he ruled help ahead of projection.

Stata help is SMCL, not markdown. Run:

    python tools/make_sthlp.py            # writes stata/equipop.sthlp
    python tools/make_sthlp.py --check    # exit 1 if out of date

# the option has no counterpart box in a GIS dialog (prefix, replace),
